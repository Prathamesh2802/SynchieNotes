1. I Installed the NPM Packages such as Express, Express-Session, Mongoose, Passport, Passport-local
2. Then i created app.js in src folder then i imported those packages and also created a route which is pointed towards server/route/index.js
3. Also in app.js, I defined use public page as static pages in which first i have added the style.css for css design
4. Later I have then defined views where i have Implemented the Layouts for different Pages.
5. In route page, I have created different apis for different operations such as login, registration, logout etc that api will be linked to their certain controllers
6. I also defined partials to store Different pages sections such as 1. Import css/js 2. Navigation 3.Footer 4.Main Content
7. Created Static registration and login page which is located in views
8. on registration ejs page i have performed post request which will then redirect in route
9. Also Created the controller page which contains all the processes login and registration or even redirect methods which is linked from route page.
10. In the end created a js file in public/script to perform onclick function,
which contains post request (installed axios for post request) that will redirect it in route page for post request operation
or optionally you can just directly use post request in login ejs form the same way registration ejs did without the need of axios.
